        <p>Thank you for your interest in HOUSE &lsquo;N&rsquo; PRO, an Internet platform ("APPLICATION"). HOUSE &lsquo;N&rsquo; PRO provides consumers (collectively, "Consumers" and individually, "Consumer" or "you") an online venue to solicit quotes for trades and services from service providers and professionals in various lines of work and commerce (collectively "Service Providers"). By registering on the APPLICATION, you may become a Consumer at no cost and will have the ability to request quotes for services. References to websites shall include, but is not limited to, any and all uses of HOUSE &lsquo;N&rsquo; PRO via mobile applications, mobile devices, personal computers, email, telephones or other electronic devices.</p>
        <h3>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>This APPLICATION and HOUSE &lsquo;N&rsquo; PRO 's services are offered to you for use only in the United States and are conditioned upon your acceptance without modification, of the following terms, conditions, and notices contained in this HOUSE &lsquo;N&rsquo; PRO Consumer Agreement ("Agreement"). Please read this Agreement carefully. Regardless of whether you register with the APPLICATION, your use of the APPLICATION and any related services constitutes your agreement to all such terms, conditions, and notices. You agree and understand that certain features of the APPLICATION may be subject to additional terms and conditions or registration requirements. You agree to abide by these additional terms, and you further agree that a violation of those terms while you are accessing the APPLICATION shall constitute a breach of this Agreement. This Agreement also includes HOUSE &lsquo;N&rsquo; PRO's Privacy Policy and any notices regarding the APPLICATION.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that HOUSE &lsquo;N&rsquo; PRO may amend this Agreement at any time by posting a revised version of this Agreement on the APPLICATION or by notifying Consumers directly in HOUSE &lsquo;N&rsquo; PRO's sole discretion. Your continued use of the APPLICATION after any such changes are made to this Agreement shall constitute your consent to such changes. HOUSE &lsquo;N&rsquo; PRO does not and will not assume any obligation to notify Consumers of any changes to this Agreement, or the creation or modification of any additional terms. You are responsible for remaining knowledgeable about the terms, conditions and notices of the Agreement.</p>
        <h4>Use and Age Restrictions</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>Use of the APPLICATION is permitted only by individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, use of the HOUSE &lsquo;N&rsquo; PRO APPLICATION is not permitted by anyone under the age of 18. If you do not qualify, please do not use the APPLICATION.</p>
        <h4>Service Requests and quotes
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>Upon registration with HOUSE &lsquo;N&rsquo; PRO, a Consumer may submit through the APPLICATION a request for quotes for service or work ("Get a Quote") from Service Providers. Consumers must provide required information (e.g., what they want done, when they want it done, where they want it done) to submit a valid Service Request. All Service Requests posted through the APPLICATION must be lawful and not in violation of any city ordinance, state, local or federal law. A submitted Service Request must be descriptive enough to allow a Service Provider to ascertain the necessary details to submit a fully informed offer to provide the requested services ("Quote"). After submission of a Service Request, HOUSE &lsquo;N&rsquo; PRO will inform Service Providers with profiles that match the services requested by Consumer. Nevertheless, HOUSE &lsquo;N&rsquo; PRO does not and cannot guarantee that there will be Service Providers who are capable of or willing to complete the requested services at the time and place requested or that Consumer will receive Quotes from Service Provider(s).</p>
        <p>When a Consumer accepts a Quote, he or she explicitly implies an offer to pay the Service Provider in the amount of the Quote for services rendered. Accepting a Quote amounts to entering a binding legal agreement to pay the Service Provider once the Service is rendered. Please consider carefully when you accept a Quote from a Service Provider.</p>
        <p>When submitting a Service Request, ensure that the Service Request does not infringe upon the copyright, trademark or other rights of any third party. By posting a Service Request you represent that the Service Request is lawful and does not infringe on the intellectual property of any third party. Your description of the Service Request must be truthful and accurate. Any Service Request posted on the APPLICATION: (a) shall not be fraudulent; (b) shall not infringe any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy; (c) shall not violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation (including without limitation those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination or false advertising); (d) shall not be defamatory, trade libelous, unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing; (e) shall not be obscene or contain child pornography; and (f) shall not contain any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information.</p>
